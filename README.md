# Java Backend Studies 🚀

This repository contains my study projects and exercises developed while pursuing a Software Engineering degree at the State University of Pará (UEPA). It focuses on mastering Java Backend development, from core logic to advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java 17+
* **Framework Concepts:** Dependency Injection, Interfaces, and Inversion of Control.
* **Tools:** IntelliJ IDEA, Git, and GitHub.

## 📁 Project Highlights

### 1. Contract Processing System
A professional-grade exercise designed to automate contract installments.
* **Key Concepts:** Interfaces, Composition, and Dependency Injection.
* **Description:** Developed a service that calculates installments for online payments (PayPal integration) using `LocalDate` for date manipulation and a decoupled architecture to allow easy service swapping.
* **Path:** `/contract-processing`

### 2. Worker Contracts Management
* **Key Concepts:** Enums, Composition, and OOP.
* **Description:** A system to calculate worker income based on base salary plus commissions from multiple contracts.
* **Path:** `/worker-contracts`

### 3. Social Media Post Simulation
* **Key Concepts:** Object Composition and String Manipulation (`StringBuilder`).
* **Description:** Modeling a social media environment with posts and comments to practice object relationships.
* **Path:** `/social-media-post`

## 📈 Roadmap & Evolution
- [x] OOP Foundations (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
- [x] Exception Handling and File I/O
- [x] Interfaces and Dependency Injection
- [ ] Generics, Set, and Map (Next Step)
- [ ] Refactoring financial values to `BigDecimal`
- [ ] Transitioning to Spring Boot Framework
